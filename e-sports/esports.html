            <div class="faq-content">
                The most known real time strategy games would be Warcraft and Starcraft [Blizzard] but also Command of Conquers [EA Games / Westwood Studios] or Age of Empire [Microsoft Corporation]. The main goal of those games are to build your own base and destroy the ennemy base. Different units will be more effective versus a specific type of units (Example of a very notorious game as comparison: Rock – Paper -Scissors.

                The competitions are mostly played on PC with mouse and keyboard. A Pro player can fulfill about 300 meaningful APMs (Action per Minute) whereas a casual player usually lies between 50 – 100 APMs. Those actions can be: Different Building contructions, Building units, commanding units (movement, attack, defend, group) and general map and base supervising (moving between different part of the map).             </div>

            <div class="faq-title"><i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i> First Person Shooter (FPS) & Third Person Shooter (TPS)</div>
            <div class="faq-content">
                FPS games are played in an ego-perspective (EGO Shooter is also a term of use). The player only sees the hands, weapons of their virtual character and the map in front of them. (Example of games: Counter Strike: Global Offensive – CS:GO ; Valorant ; Call of Duty ; Rainbow Siege ; etc.).

                TPS has a big difference compared to FPS as the player can see the whole character (Avatar) and has a camera view of the game slightly above the avatar. (Example of games: Fortnite ; Splatoon ; etc.).
                
                The Main platform of those genres usually are PC, playing with mouse and keyboard, however the console platform also finds its esport community. 
                The rulesets vary between the games and their genres.            </div>

            <div class="faq-title"><i class="fas fa-dragon"></i> Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)</div>
            <div class="faq-content">
                Biggest MOBA games on the market would be League of Legends [Riot Games], DoTA [Valve] and Pokemon Unite [TiMi Studio Group / The Pokémon Company]. They are strategic games where 2 teams of each 5 players faces each other. The map is split in 2 identical mirrored sides. The main goal is to destroy the opponent’s base (usually one main building in particular).

                The particularity of this genre is that the players are “leveling up” during the process of the game. The player gains experience by various eliminations of opponents but also so-called Minions (which are Non-playable characters – NPCs) that move in a fixed way.
                
                The game is played mainly on PC with mouse and keyboards, however there are several games which came out on the mobile platform.            </div>
